# Source register

Checked **27 September 2026**. Scope: all 14 workflow cards on [VYR Agent OS](https://vyrwork.com/agent-os) and their individual detail pages. These are VYR's public descriptions, not an independent production audit.

## Interpretation rules

The overview establishes the catalogue and maturity labels. Detail pages supply the specific worked path: for example, F&B's overview covers reservations, order intake and stock operations, while its detail page illustrates supplier reorder. This atlas chooses that detailed path for its concrete example. Similarly, the HR case focuses on onboarding, tuition on trial booking, and compliance on evidence preparation; broader areas on the overview remain scoping possibilities rather than additional deployed workflows.

Educational additions are explicitly labelled: agent role names, decomposition into parallel work, handoff contracts, hypothetical examples, evaluation criteria and model recommendations. They should be validated against the actual implementation before use in a deployment claim.

The source pages distinguish preparation, approval, external execution and verification. This atlas preserves those distinctions. It does not turn a draft into a sent message, a scheduled post into a delivered post, an invoice draft into a payment, or a prepared evidence pack into certification.

## Image model source

[GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst — OpenAI Docs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-image-2.5-sunburst) confirms the model ID `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`. [Image generation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation) documents selecting it in the Image API. Model availability in documentation does not prove this session's built-in image tool is using it; actual generation provenance is recorded separately.
