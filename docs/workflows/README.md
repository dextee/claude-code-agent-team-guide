# The Agent Workflow Atlas

**14 concrete goals. Specialised agents. Visible handoffs. Human-owned decisions.**

A companion to the [Claude Code Agent Team Guide](../../README.md), grounded in every workflow listed on [VYR Agent OS](https://vyrwork.com/agent-os). Source pages checked **27 September 2026**.

Start with the [AI Receptionist](ai-receptionist.md): a concierge coordinates knowledge, availability and booking agents, while unsupported requests go to staff with their context intact.

| VYR source status | Count | What it means here |
|---|---:|---|
| LIVE | 3 | The public site describes a production backend; important limits are retained below. |
| DEMO | 1 | Working voice software on sample data, without live booking integration. |
| BUILT FOR YOU | 10 | Specified designs to build and integrate; not deployed client results. |

The diagrams propose **how agents can cooperate**. They are educational designs, not audited maps of VYR's private infrastructure. Worked examples are fictional. Measures are evaluation suggestions, not achieved results. Model selection belongs to the [build playbook](BUILD_PLAYBOOK.md); no particular model is attributed to VYR's production systems.

## Read the live boundaries first

- **Content Operations:** a live eleven-agent pipeline, grouped here into five educational roles; the main page says new generation is paused behind its approval backlog. Publication requires a human decision.
- **Lead Generation:** source, enrich, deduplicate and check prospect records; the workflow ends at a reviewed CSV and never sends outreach.
- **Social Command Center:** its live FeedHive console is read-only. A separate publisher checks approval against exact copy, image, accounts, labels and schedule before any new write.
- **Voice Receptionist:** uses sample business facts and calendars. A sample booking is not an actual appointment.

VYR's proposed cross-workflow shared-memory layer is **build-to-order and not wired into the three live pipelines**. Run-specific handoff packets in these diagrams do not imply deployed shared memory. [Current source overview](https://vyrwork.com/agent-os)

## Using the atlas

Each case includes a goal, trigger, collaboration diagram, input/output contracts, human decision, completion condition, fictional worked example and evaluation ideas. Read the [build playbook](BUILD_PLAYBOOK.md) to translate a case into an implementation brief. See the [source register](SOURCES.md) for all 14 original workflow pages.

Raster illustrations are being prepared from the [14 image prompts](IMAGE_PROMPTS.md). [Artwork provenance](ARTWORK.md) records whether the requested GPT Image 2.5 path has actually generated assets; a prepared prompt does not count as a generated image.
